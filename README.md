# Seek and Steal (a Unity small project)
### In this repository you will find a small game made in unity engine. This game have been developed for the pratical exam part of the university course "VideoGameProgramming 2021-2022" (Universit√† degli studi di Udine).

In this repo, you can find:
- A working version of the game (in last_build folder)
- The unity3D project (feel free to use it for your purposes; please read additional notes reported below)
- A roadmap file with version history, bugs, user testing notes and other infos

### - Short game description:

The given  game  theme (for the exam) was  "hide and seek".  In  this  game  you  are  a  thief which  has  to  seek  for  treasures  to  steal  around  the  map.
While  doing  so  you  have  to  hide  from  hostile  guards. They can see you, but you can hide behind obstacles and inside tall grass. They can hear you running, so be careful. Enojy the game :)

### - Will you continue the development of the game?

I found very fun and satisfying to build a little working game for this project. I have a lot of ideas behind this game which, in my opinion, could be completely re-designed and improved. A lot of mechanics (actually 99% of the game) has been rushed, in order to complete the project within the deadlines. Every aspect of the game could be redesigned in order to create a more varied, refined and fun final product.

### - Additional notes for importing/building the project
When opening the project in unity be careful to press "NO" when asked to enable the new input system. By pressing "YES", you will disable the old input system and the player movement system will no longer work. Only free assets (from the asset store) have been used, so don't worry about them.
